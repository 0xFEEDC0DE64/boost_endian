Boost Endian library

To experiment with the Endian library, various other boost libraries must be
available. So you need to clone a current version of boost if you
have not already done so.

Boost.Endian is a header-only library, so there is no need to run a build
for it, although you may need to do a "b2 headers".

If your clone of boost is already in place, please remember to:

  cd modular-boost
  git pull
  git submodule update --init
  git submodule update
  ./b2 headers
  
On Windows, change the "./" is omitted.
