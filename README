Boost Endian library

To experiment with the Endian library, various other boost libraries must be
available. So you need to clone or install a current version of Boost if you
have notalready done so.

Boost.Endian is a header-only library, so there is no need to run a build
for it. These instructions do assume bootstrap has been run so that b2 is
in your path environmental variable.
