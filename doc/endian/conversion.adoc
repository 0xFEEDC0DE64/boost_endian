# Endian Conversion Functions

## Introduction

Header `boost/endian/conversion.hpp` provides byte order reversal and conversion
functions that convert objects of the built-in integer types between native,
big, or little endian byte ordering. User defined types are also supported.

## Reference

Functions are implemented `inline` if appropriate. For {cpp}03 compilers,
`noexcept` is elided. Boost scoped enum emulation is used so that the library
still works for compilers that do not support scoped enums.

### Definitions

*Endianness* refers to the ordering of bytes within internal or external
integers and other arithmetic data. Most-significant byte first is called
*big endian* ordering. Least-significant byte first is called
*little endian* ordering. Other orderings are possible and some CPU
architectures support both big and little ordering.

NOTE: The names are derived from
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift[Jonathan Swift]'s satirical novel
_http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver's_Travels[Gulliver's Travels]_, where
rival kingdoms opened their soft-boiled eggs at different ends. Wikipedia has an
extensive description of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness[Endianness].

The standard integral types ({cpp}std 3.9.1) except `bool` are collectively
called the *endian types*.

The values of `order::little` and `order::big` shall not be equal to one
another.

The value of `order::native` shall be:

* equal to `order::big` if the execution environment is big endian, otherwise
* equal to `order::little` if the execution environment is little endian,
otherwise
* unequal to both `order::little` and `order::big`.

### Requirements

#### Template argument requirements

The template definitions in the `boost/endian/conversion.hpp` header refer to
various named requirements whose details are set out in the tables in this
subsection. In these tables, `T` is an object or reference type to be supplied
by a {cpp} program instantiating a template; `x` is a value of type (possibly
`const`) `T`; `mlx` is a modifiable lvalue of type `T`.

[#conversion_endianreversible]
##### EndianReversible requirements (in addition to `CopyConstructible`)

[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Expression |Return |Requirements
|`endian_reverse(x)` |`T`
a|`T` is an endian type or a class type.

If `T` is an endian type, returns the value of `x` with the order of bytes
reversed.

If `T` is a class type, the function:

* Returns the value of `x` with the order of bytes reversed for all data members
of types or arrays of types that meet the `EndianReversible` requirements, and;
* Is a non-member function in the same namespace as `T` that can be found by
argument dependent lookup (ADL).
|===

[#conversion_endianreversibleinplace]
##### EndianReversibleInplace requirements (in addition to `CopyConstructible`)

[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Expression |Requirements
|`endian_reverse_inplace(mlx)`
a|`T` is an endian type or a class type.

If `T` is an endian type, reverses the order of bytes in `mlx`.

If `T` is a class type, the function:

* Reverses the order of bytes of all data members of `mlx` that have types or
arrays of types that meet the `EndianReversible` or `EndianReversibleInplace`
requirements, and;
* Is a non-member function in the same namespace as `T` that can be found by
argument dependent lookup (ADL).
|===

NOTE: Because there is a function template for `endian_reverse_inplace` that
calls `endian_reverse`, only `endian_reverse` is required for a user-defined
type to meet the `EndianReversibleInplace` requirements. Although User-defined
types are not required to supply an `endian_reverse_inplace` function, doing so
may improve efficiency.

#### Customization points for user-defined types (UDTs)

This subsection describes requirements on the Endian library's  implementation.

The library's function templates requiring
`<<conversion_endianreversible,EndianReversible>>` are required to perform
reversal of endianness if needed by making an unqualified call to
`endian_reverse()`.

The library's function templates requiring
`<<conversion_endianreversibleinplace,EndianReversibleInplace>>` are required to
perform reversal of endianness if needed by making an unqualified call to
`endian_reverse_inplace()`.

See `example/udt_conversion_example.cpp` for an example user-defined type.

## FAQ

See the <<overview_faq,Endian home page>> FAQ for a library-wide FAQ.

*Why are both value returning and modify-in-place functions provided?*

* Returning the result by value is the standard C and {cpp} idiom for functions
that compute a value from an argument. Modify-in-place functions allow cleaner
code in many real-world endian use cases and are more efficient for user-defined
types that have members such as string data that do not need to be reversed.
Thus both forms are provided.

*Why are exact-length 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit integers supported rather than the
built-in char, short, int, long, long long, etc?*

* The primary use case, portable file or network data, needs these de facto
standard sizes. Using types that vary with the platform would greatly limit
portability for both programs and data.

*Why not use the Linux names (htobe16, htole16, be16toh, le16toh, etc.) ?*

* Those names are non-standard and vary even between POSIX-like operating
systems. A {cpp} library TS was going to use those names, but found they were
sometimes implemented as macros. Since macros do not respect scoping and
namespace rules, to use them would be very error prone.

## Acknowledgements

Tomas Puverle was instrumental in identifying and articulating the need to
support endian conversion as separate from endian integer types. Phil Endecott
suggested the form of the value returning signatures. Vicente Botet and other
reviewers suggested supporting  user defined types. General reverse template
implementation approach using `std::reverse` suggested by Mathias Gaunard.
Portable implementation approach for 16, 32, and 64-bit integers suggested by
tymofey, with avoidance of undefined behavior as suggested by Giovanni Piero
Deretta, and a further refinement suggested by Pyry Jahkola. Intrinsic builtins
implementation approach for 16, 32, and 64-bit integers suggested by several
reviewers, and by David Stone, who provided his Boost licensed macro
implementation that became the starting point for
`boost/endian/detail/intrinsic.hpp`.  Pierre Talbot provided the
`int8_t endian_reverse()` and templated `endian_reverse_inplace()`
implementations.
