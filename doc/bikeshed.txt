Key points:

* These names are defined in a user namespace as customization points to be found by
  ADL, and so cannot depend on the enclosing namespace name to signal readers that they
  are related to endianness.
* These functions are rarely called directly by user code, which is more likely to use
  the various conditional functions instead. So explicitness is more important than 
  brevity.
