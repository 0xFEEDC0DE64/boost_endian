<title>Endian Mini-Review</title>

<p>Here is what needs to be done to get the library ready for a mini-review:



</p>

  <p><b>Common use case scenarios should be developed.</b></p>
  <blockquote>

  <p>Done. See <a href="index.html#Use-cases">Use cases</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Example programs should be developed for the common use case scenarios.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Documentation should illuminate the differences between endian 
integer/float type and endian conversion approaches to the common use 
case scenarios, and provide guidelines for choosing the most appropriate 
approach in user's applications.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Done. See <a href="index.html#Choosing">Choosing between endian conversion 
  functions, endian buffer types, and endian arithmetic types</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Conversion functions supplying results via return should be provided.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Done. See <a href="conversion.html">conversion docs</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Platform specific performance enhancements such as use of compiler intrinsics or relaxed alignment requirements should be supported.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Done. Compiler (Clang, GCC, VisualC++, etc.) intrinsics and built-in 
  functions are used in the implementation where appropriate, as requested. See
  <a href="index.html#Intrinsic">Built-in support for Intrinsics</a>. See
  <a href="index.html#Timings">Timings for Example 2</a> to gauge the impact of 
  intrinsics.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Endian integer (and floating) types should be implemented via the 
conversion functions. If that can't be done efficiently, consideration 
should be given to expanding the conversion function signatures to 
resolve the inefficiencies.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Done. For the endian types, the implementation uses the endian conversion 
  functions, and thus the intrinsics, as requested.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Benchmarks that measure performance should be provided. It should be 
possible to compare platform specific performance enhancements against 
portable base implementations, and to compare endian integer approaches 
against endian conversion approaches for the common use case scenarios.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Done. See <a href="index.html#Timings">Timings for Example 2</a>. The <code>endian/test</code> directory 
  also contains several additional benchmark and speed test programs.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Float (32-bits) and double (64-bits) should be supported. IEEE 754 is 
the primary use case.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Done. The <a href="buffers.html">endian buffer types</a>,&nbsp;
  <a href="arithmetic.html">endian arithmetic types</a> and
  <a href="conversion.html">endian conversion functions</a> now support 32-bit (<code>float)</code> 
  and 64-bit <code>(double)</code> floating point, as requested.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Support for user defined types (UDTs) is desirable, and should be 
provided where there would be no conflict with the other concerns.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Done. See <a href="conversion.html#Requirements">conversion requirements</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>There is some concern that endian integer/float arithmetic operations 
might used inadvertently or inappropriately. The impact of adding an endian_buffer 
  class without arithmetic operations should be investigated.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Done. The endian types have been decomposed into class template <code>
  <a href="buffers.html">endian_buffer</a></code> and class template <code>
  <a href="arithmetic.html">endian_arithmetic</a></code>. Class
  <code>endian_buffer</code> is a public base class for <code>endian_arithmetic</code>, 
  and can also be used by users as a stand-alone class.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Stream insertion and extraction of the endian integer/float types should 
  be documented and included in the test coverage.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Done. See <a href="types.html#Stream-inserter">Stream inserter</a> and
  <a href="types.html#Stream-extractor">Stream extractor</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Binary I/O support that was investigated during development of the Endian 
  library should be put up for mini-review for inclusion in the Boost I/O 
  library.</b></p>
