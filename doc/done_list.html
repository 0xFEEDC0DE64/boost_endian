<h1>Endian changes since formal review</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Both the endian types and endian conversion functions now support 32-bit (<code>float)</code> and 
  64-bit <code>(double)</code> floating point, as requested.</li>
  <li>Both the endian types and endian conversion functions now support UDTs, as requested.</li>
  <li>The conversion functions have been much revised, 
  refactored, and otherwise improved based on review comments.<ul>
    <li>Both return-by-value and modify-in-place interfaces are provided, as 
    requested.</li>
    <li>Synonyms for the BSD byte swapping function names popularized by OS X 
    and Linux are provided, so that that developers already used to these names 
    can continue to use them if they wish.</li>
    <li>In addition to the named-endianness functions, functions that perform 
    compile-time (via template) and run-time (via function argument) dispatch 
    are now provided, as requested.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Compiler (Clang, GCC, VisualC++, etc.) intrinsics and built-in functions 
  are used in the implementation where appropriate, as requested.</li>
  <li>For the endian  types, the implementation uses the endian conversion functions, 
  and thus the intrinsics, 
  as requested.</li>
  <li>Headers have been renamed to endian/types.hpp and endian/conversion.hpp. 
  Infrastructure file names changed accordingly.</li>
  <li>C++11 features such as <code>noexcept</code> are now used, while still 
  supporting C++03 compilers.</li>
  <li>Documentation revised and expanded, as requested.</li>
  <li>Acknowledgements have been updated.</li>
  <li>Headers have been reorganized to make them easier to read, 
  with a synopsis at the front and implementation following, as requested.</li>
  <li><code>reverse_value()</code> overloads for <code>int8_t</code> and <code>
  uint8_t</code> have been added for improved generality. (Pierre Talbot)</li>
  <li>Overloads of <code>reverse()</code> have been replaced with a single <code>
  reverse()</code> template. (Pierre Talbot)</li>
</ul>
