<h1>Endian changes since formal review</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Headers rename to endian/types.hpp and endian/conversion.hpp. 
  Infrastructure file names changed accordingly.</li>
  <li>The conversion.hpp conversion functions have been much revised, refactored, 
  renamed and otherwise improved based on review comments.<ul>
    <li>UDT's are supported.</li>
    <li><code>float</code>(32-bits) and <code>double</code> (64-bits) are 
    supported.</li>
    <li>Both return-by-value and modify-in-place interfaces are provided.</li>
    <li>Synonyms for the BSD byte swapping function names popularized by OS X 
    and Linux are provided, so that that developers already used to these name 
    can continue to use them if they wish.</li>
    <li>In addition to the fixed endianness functions, functions that perform 
    compile-time (via template) and run-time (via function argument) dispatch 
    are now provided.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Compiler (Clang, GCC, VisualC++, etc.) intrinsics and built-in functions 
  are used in the implementation where appropriate.</li>
  <li>For the aligned endian integer types, the implementation uses 
  conversion.hpp conversion functions.</li>
  <li>C++11 features such as <code>noexcept</code> are used, while still 
  supporting C++03 compilers.</li>
  <li>Acknowledgements have been updated.</li>
  <li>Headers have been reorganized to make them easier to read, as requested, 
  with a synopsis at the front and implementation following.</li>
</ul>
